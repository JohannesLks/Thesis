## 1. Core Problem

The paper addresses the significant challenge of securing Internet of Things (IoT) devices. The IoT landscape is characterized by extreme heterogeneity (diverse device types, brands, firmware) and widespread vulnerabilities. Attackers exploit this by performing pre-attack reconnaissance to identify specific device models and tailor their attacks accordingly. Traditional IoT honeypots are often low-interaction and easily detectable due to fixed, static responses, making them ineffective at capturing sophisticated, targeted attacks. There is a need for scalable, adaptive, and high-interaction honeypots that can convincingly mimic a wide range of IoT devices to deceive attackers and gather high-quality threat intelligence.

## 2. HoneyIoT: Key Contributions & Features

HoneyIoT is a novel, adaptive, high-interaction honeypot framework designed specifically for the IoT environment. Its primary innovation lies in using Reinforcement Learning (RL) to dynamically adapt its behavior to engage attackers more effectively.

### 2.1. Architecture

The HoneyIoT architecture is composed of two primary components:

*   **Frontend:** A virtual machine exposed to the internet that emulates the network services of various IoT devices (e.g., open ports for HTTP, RTSP, etc.). It is responsible for:
    *   Parsing incoming attacker requests.
    *   Forwarding request details to the RL agent.
    *   Detecting malware download commands (like `wget`) and passing them to a sandboxed crawler for sample collection.
    *   Receiving the chosen response from the agent and performing content mutation before sending it to the attacker.
*   **Reinforcement Learning (RL) Agent:** This is the core of HoneyIoT's intelligence. It models the interaction with an attacker as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and uses an RL algorithm (specifically, Proximal Policy Optimization - PPO) to decide the best response to send back. It aims to maximize a long-term reward, which is highest when an attacker is successfully deceived into uploading malware.

The system is initially trained on a corpus of real attack traces collected by exposing actual, vulnerable IoT devices (cameras, routers, smart plugs) to the internet.

### 2.2. Adaptation Mechanism

HoneyIoT's adaptiveness is driven by Reinforcement Learning. The process is formulated as an MDP:

*   **State:** The state is defined as the sequence of request packets received from an attacker during a session. This history provides context for the interaction.
*   **Action:** An action is the selection of a specific response from a pre-collected database of valid responses from real IoT devices. The honeypot chooses which device persona to adopt in its reply.
*   **Reward Function:** The system is rewarded based on the outcome of its actions. The highest reward is given for successfully capturing malware, a moderate reward for triggering a vulnerability exploit, and a negative reward if the attacker terminates the session prematurely. This incentivizes the agent to learn interaction sequences that lead to successful compromise.

By leveraging RL, HoneyIoT can learn complex, multi-step attack patterns from the training data and choose responses that are most likely to keep an attacker engaged, bypass their pre-attack checks, and lead them down a path to revealing their tools and malware.

### 2.3. High-Interaction Capabilities

HoneyIoT achieves high interaction through two main techniques:

1.  **RL-Driven Responses:** Unlike honeypots with static logic, HoneyIoT dynamically selects from a vast pool of real responses. This allows it to engage in more complex and convincing dialogues with attackers, successfully navigating the pre-attack checks that would unmask simpler honeypots.
2.  **Differential Analysis & Content Mutation:** To avoid fingerprinting, HoneyIoT does not just replay static, captured responses. It first performs a differential analysis on responses from real devices to identify which fields are dynamic (e.g., timestamps, session IDs, sensor readings). It then mutates these fields in real-time before sending a response, creating high-fidelity replies that appear authentic and unique to each interaction. This includes updating timestamps to the current time, randomizing session tokens, and selecting plausible system-state values (e.g., a camera's pan/tilt angle) from a database of valid, observed values.

This combination allows HoneyIoT to convincingly emulate not just a single device, but a whole range of them, and to maintain the illusion of a real, live system throughout an extended interaction.

## 3. Relevance to Thesis

This paper is a key piece of related work for the ADLAH thesis, as it validates the problem space and shares the goal of creating an adaptive honeypot architecture. However, it differs significantly in its approach and scope.

*   **Shared Goals, Different Approaches:** Both HoneyIoT and ADLAH aim to create adaptive cybersecurity defenses using machine learning. HoneyIoT employs RL to select the optimal response *within a single honeypot* to emulate various IoT device profiles. In contrast, ADLAH proposes a higher-level, multi-layered architecture where RL is used as an *orchestrator*. ADLAH's RL agent doesn't just select a response; it dynamically Provisions, configures, and chains different types of honeypots (which could include IoT honeypots like HoneyIoT, but also web, ICS, etc.) to construct a tailored defense layer in response to evolving threats. HoneyIoT adapts the persona of one honeypot, while ADLAH adapts the structure of an entire honeynet.
*   **Scope and Focus:** HoneyIoT's focus is narrowly defined on emulating a diverse set of individual IoT devices. Its contribution is a sophisticated, high-interaction *honeypot instance*. ADLAH's scope is much broader, defining a comprehensive *honeynet architecture*. It is concerned with the strategic, network-level deployment and management of heterogeneous honeypots, traffic redirection, and the orchestration of the entire defensive posture, not just the behavior of a single decoy.
*   **State of the Art:** HoneyIoT serves as an excellent example of the state of the art in adaptive, single-system honeypots. It demonstrates the value of using RL for deception and strengthens the motivation for the ADLAH thesis. By showing that adaptation is effective at the micro (honeypot) level, it provides a strong foundation for the argument that a more advanced, RL-driven orchestration at the macro (honeynet) level is a logical and powerful next step. HoneyIoT solves the problem of "how to make one honeypot smarter," whereas ADLAH addresses "how to make a network of honeypots smarter."
