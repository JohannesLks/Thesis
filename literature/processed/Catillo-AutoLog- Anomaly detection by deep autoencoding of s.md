# Summary of "AutoLog: Anomaly detection by deep autoencoding of system logs"

This paper by Catillo et al. introduces **AutoLog**, an unsupervised anomaly detection system for system logs that leverages a deep autoencoder. The core idea is to model the normal behavior of a system based on its log outputs and then identify anomalies as significant deviations from this learned norm, without requiring prior knowledge or labeled examples of anomalous events.

## Core Methodology

The AutoLog system operates in a two-stage pipeline:

1.  **Scoring:** This stage transforms raw, unstructured log messages into meaningful numerical vectors.
2.  **Anomaly Detection:** This stage uses a deep autoencoder trained on "normal" scores to identify anomalies.

### 1. Log Parsing and Vectorization (Scoring)

AutoLog's approach is designed to be agnostic to the specific format of the logs, making it applicable to proprietary and heterogeneous systems. The process is as follows:

*   **Log Sampling:** System logs from various sources (Logging Entities or LEs) are collected in fixed-time windows called "chunks."
*   **Parsing:** Variable parts of log messages (e.g., timestamps, IP addresses) are removed, retaining only the constant, descriptive parts of the message. Special characters and punctuation are also stripped.
*   **Term Weighting & Scoring:** The parsed log chunks are tokenized into terms. A numerical score is computed for each chunk using a **logarithmic entropy** term-weighting technique. This score quantifies how much a given chunk deviates from a pre-established baseline of normal log chunks. The entropy of a term is calculated based on its frequency distribution across normal log chunks. A higher score indicates a greater deviation and a higher likelihood of an anomaly.
*   **Vector Creation:** The scores from all logging entities for a given time window are aggregated into a single numerical vector, which serves as the input for the neural network.

### 2. Deep Autoencoder for Anomaly Detection

The anomaly detection component is a deep autoencoder, a type of neural network trained to reconstruct its own input.

*   **Architecture:** The model consists of an **encoder** that compresses the input vector into a lower-dimensional representation (the "bottleneck") and a **decoder** that reconstructs the original vector from this compressed representation.
*   **Training:** The autoencoder is trained **exclusively on vectors derived from normal system operations** (a semi-supervised approach). During training, the network learns to minimize the **reconstruction error**—the difference between the original input vector and the reconstructed output vector.
*   **Anomaly Identification:** Once trained, the model is highly effective at reconstructing normal log vectors, resulting in a low reconstruction error. However, when presented with a vector derived from anomalous logs—data it has never seen before—the network struggles to reconstruct it accurately. This leads to a **high reconstruction error**. A predefined **anomaly threshold** is applied to this error score; if the error exceeds the threshold, the log chunk is flagged as an anomaly.

## Relevance to Thesis

This paper is highly relevant to the **ADLAH (An Adaptive Multi-Layered Honeynet Architecture)** framework, specifically in the context of the **post-interaction analysis** layer.

AutoLog provides a concrete, validated method for implementing an unsupervised anomaly detection engine that can process the vast amounts of system logs generated by high-interaction honeypots. After the ADLAH's RL agent has orchestrated an interaction and an attacker has engaged with a honeypot, the resulting logs (`/var/log`, application logs, etc.) can be fed into a system like AutoLog.

The key contributions to the ADLAH concept are:

1.  **Automated Forensic Analysis:** ADLAH's goal is to not only capture but also *understand* attacker behavior. AutoLog offers a way to automate the forensic analysis of system-level activity. It can sift through thousands of log entries to automatically flag unusual sequences of commands, error messages, or system calls that deviate from the honeypot's baseline state. This allows for the discovery of novel attack patterns without relying on pre-existing signatures.
2.  **Complementary Role to the RL Agent:** It is crucial to distinguish the function of a system like AutoLog from the ADLAH's core RL agent.
    *   The **RL agent** is an *orchestrator* that operates on real-time **network events** and high-level alerts to make strategic decisions about resource allocation and deception.
    *   **AutoLog** is a *forensic analyst* that performs deep, offline (or near-real-time) analysis on the **data artifacts** (system logs) collected *as a result* of that orchestration. It provides the detailed, low-level insights that complement the RL agent's high-level view.
3.  **Unsupervised and Adaptive:** ADLAH is designed to be adaptive. AutoLog's unsupervised nature aligns perfectly with this principle. It does not require a fixed library of attack signatures, which would quickly become outdated. Instead, it learns the "normal" state of a given honeypot environment and can detect zero-day techniques or deviations from standard TTPs, providing a continuous stream of valuable intelligence.

In summary, Catillo et al.'s AutoLog provides a strong theoretical and practical foundation for building a key data analysis component within the ADLAH architecture, enabling the automated discovery of novel threats from honeypot log data.
