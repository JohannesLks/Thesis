# Analysis of "Using Reinforcement Learning to Conceal Honeypot Functionality" by Dowling et al.

This document provides a summary and analysis of the conference paper "Using Reinforcement Learning to Conceal Honeypot Functionality" by Seamus Dowling, Michael Schukat, and Enda Barrett, published in the proceedings of ECML PKDD 2018.

## Core Framework and Comparison

After a thorough review, it is clear that this paper presents the **same core research and framework** as the previously analyzed journal paper, "Improving adaptive honeypot functionality with efficient reinforcement learning parameters for automated malware," by the same authors. The fundamental concepts, including the problem statement, methodology, and experimental setup, are nearly identical.

Both papers describe an adaptive SSH honeypot (`Cowrie`) that uses Reinforcement Learning (RL), specifically the SARSA algorithm, to learn how to respond to automated attacks. The goal is to overcome basic honeypot detection mechanisms employed by malware (e.g., a Mirai-like botnet) to prolong interaction and capture more comprehensive attack data.

Key similarities include:
*   **Objective:** To conceal honeypot functionality from automated malware.
*   **Methodology:** A SARSA-based RL agent integrated with the Cowrie honeypot.
*   **State-Action Space:** A discrete space where states are attacker commands and actions are `allow`, `block`, or `substitute`.
*   **Reward Function:** A simple binary reward (`+1`) for transitioning to a new "valid" command (`L`, `C`, `CC`), incentivizing longer command sequences.
*   **Experiment:** A 30-day live deployment comparing the adaptive honeypot to a standard high-interaction Cowrie instance, both targeted by the same Mirai-like bot.
*   **Results:** The adaptive honeypot learns to bypass an initial detection check (related to the `mount` command) and subsequently captures four times more command transitions than the standard honeypot.
*   **Policy Evaluation:** An offline evaluation of different exploration strategies (`Epsilon-greedy`, `Boltzmann Softmax`, `State-dependent`), concluding that `Boltzmann Softmax` is the most efficient policy in a controlled environment.

This conference paper appears to be a precursor to the journal article, presenting the initial findings that were later expanded upon. There are no significant new concepts, machine learning techniques, or applications introduced here that are not covered in the other paper.

_Conclusion: This paper is largely redundant, covering the same ground as the journal article._

### Relevance to Thesis

Given the significant overlap, the relevance of this paper to the **ADLAH (Adaptive Multi-Layered Honeynet Architecture)** is identical to that of the journal version. It provides no *new* insights but reinforces the value of the core concepts.

*   **Reinforcement of Core Principles:** The paper validates the use of RL as a mechanism for real-time adaptation in honeypots. The simple state-action-reward model is effective at solving a specific, narrow problem: evading a hardcoded detection check.
*   **No New Contributions for ADLAH:** The paper does not offer new algorithms, data representation methods, or architectural ideas that could further enhance the ADLAH design beyond what was already gleaned from the journal article. The RL approach remains simplistic and narrowly focused on a single type of interaction (SSH command sequences), which contrasts with ADLAH's goal of a multi-layered, more holistic defense.
*   **Highlighting Limitations:** The paper's narrow focus underscores the need for ADLAH's more sophisticated design. Real-world adversaries use diverse and evolving TTPs, requiring an architecture that can learn and adapt across multiple layers (network, application, host) and data sources, rather than optimizing responses to a single, known script.

In summary, while this paper is a valid piece of research, its contribution to the ADLAH thesis is fully encompassed by the more detailed journal article previously analyzed. It serves as a foundational work but does not introduce new avenues for exploration for the ADLAH project.
