## Chapter 1: Introduction

This chapter lays the foundational concepts for understanding outliers.

### What is an Outlier?
Hawkins defines an outlier as "an observation which deviates so much from other observations as to arouse suspicions that it was generated by a different mechanism."

### Genesis of Outliers
Two primary mechanisms are identified:
1.  **Mechanism (i): Heavy-Tailed Distributions**: The entire dataset comes from a single, heavy-tailed distribution (e.g., Student's t-distribution), making extreme values more probable than in distributions like the normal distribution.
2.  **Mechanism (ii): Contamination**: The data is a mixture from two different distributions: a 'basic' distribution for good observations and a 'contaminating' distribution for outliers. This can be further divided into:
    *   **(iia)**: A fixed number of contaminants.
    *   **(iib)**: Each observation has a certain probability of being a contaminant (Dixon's model).

### Treatment of Outliers
The appropriate response to an outlier depends on its perceived origin:
-   **Estimation**: If outliers are considered part of a heavy-tailed distribution, robust estimators (like trimmed means) are used. Outlier rejection can be seen as a method to achieve robust estimation.
-   **Warning Signal**: Outlier tests can serve as a check on model assumptions (e.g., normality). A significant result warns that the assumed model may be inadequate.
-   **Classification**: When contamination is suspected, the goal becomes partitioning the data into 'good' observations and 'contaminants' to better understand the underlying data-generating process.

### Slippage Tests
Slippage tests are introduced as a closely related topic, where one or more populations from a group of populations have 'slipped' (e.g., have a different mean or variance). This is often a generalization of the outlier problem.

## Chapter 2: General Theoretical Principles

This chapter details the statistical theory behind outlier detection.

### Measures of Performance
Three key performance measures for an outlier test are discussed:
-   **β₁**: The probability of correctly identifying the true outlier.
-   **β₂**: The power of the test; the probability of detecting that an outlier is present, regardless of correct identification.
-   **β₃**: The conditional power; the probability of a significant result, given the contaminant is the most extreme value.

### Optimal Tests
-   **Decision Theory Approach (Karlin and Truax)**: Optimal tests are framed as multiple-decision problems. For a single outlier, the optimal procedure often involves identifying the most extreme observation and comparing a statistic based on its deviation from the rest of the sample to a critical value.
-   **Generalized Likelihood Ratio Tests**: A widely applicable method for deriving good outlier tests, although without guaranteed optimality.
-   **Locally Most Powerful Tests (Ferguson)**: For detecting small deviations from the null hypothesis, the sample skewness (for one-sided contamination) and kurtosis (for two-sided contamination) are locally optimal.

## Chapter 3: A Single Outlier in Normal Samples

This chapter is dedicated to the most common scenario: detecting a single outlier in a normally distributed sample.

-   **Optimal Statistic**: The statistic `B* = max |xᵢ - x̄| / s` (where `s` is the sample standard deviation) is optimal for detecting a single outlier when the mean and variance are unknown.
-   **Distribution Theory**: The null distribution of `B*` and its one-sided version `B` is discussed, including exact recursive formulas and the highly accurate Bonferroni approximation.
-   **Performance**: The power of these tests depends on the sample size and the magnitude of the outlier's deviation. The use of external information about the variance can improve power.

## Chapter 4: The Gamma Distribution

This chapter extends outlier detection methods to samples from gamma distributions, which is particularly relevant for analyzing variances.

-   **Cochran's Test**: For testing whether one of several variances from normal samples has slipped to the right (i.e., is larger), Cochran's statistic `X(n) / ΣXᵢ` is optimal when the degrees of freedom are equal.
-   **Performance and Robustness**: The Cochran test is shown to be more powerful and robust against certain model deviations (e.g., non-normality causing high frequencies of near-zero values) compared to Bartlett's test for homogeneity of variances.

## Chapter 5: Multiple Outliers

Detecting multiple outliers is complicated by the **masking effect**, where the presence of one outlier can hide another by inflating the sample variance.

-   **Procedures for a Known Number of Outliers**: Statistics like Tietjen and Moore's `Lk` (for `k` outliers on one side) and `Ek` (for `k` outliers on either side) are discussed. These involve removing the `k` most extreme observations and comparing the residual sum of squares to the total sum of squares.
-   **Stepwise Procedures**:
    -   **Forward Selection**: Sequentially identifies and removes the most significant outlier until no more are found. Prone to the masking effect.
    -   **Backward Elimination**: Starts by removing a pre-specified maximum number of potential outliers (`K`) and then tests them for re-inclusion one by one, from the least extreme to the most extreme. This method is immune to masking but has more complex distributional properties.

## Chapter 6: Non-Parametric Tests

Non-parametric methods are available when the underlying distribution cannot be assumed.
-   **Mosteller's Test**: A simple test based on the number of observations from the most extreme sample that exceed all observations from all other samples.
-   **Doornbos's Test**: Uses the Wilcoxon rank-sum statistic to compare each sample against all others. Generally more powerful than Mosteller's test.
-   **Scale and Multiple Slippage**: Non-parametric tests for slippage in scale (e.g., Siegel-Tukey) and multiple slippages are also presented.

## Chapter 7: Outliers from the Linear Model

This chapter addresses outlier detection in the context of linear regression and ANOVA.
-   **Residual Analysis**: Outliers are identified through residuals. The test statistic is typically a function of the studentized residual `eᵢ / √(S * aᵢᵢ)`, where `S` is the residual variance and `aᵢᵢ` is the corresponding diagonal element of the "hat" matrix.
-   **Recursive Residuals**: A set of `n-p` independent, normally distributed residuals can be calculated, which simplifies the distributional theory.
-   **Regression Formulation**: The outlier detection problem can be framed as a variable selection problem in a regression model where each observation can have its own mean shift parameter. This framework highlights the connection between outlier detection and regression diagnostics and shows why masking occurs.

## Chapter 8: Multivariate Outlier Detection

The principles of outlier detection are extended to multivariate data, typically assuming a multivariate normal distribution.

-   **Generalization of Univariate Tests**: Statistics are often based on Mahalanobis distances. The equivalent of the optimal univariate statistic `T²` is `maxᵢ Dᵢ²`, where `Dᵢ² = (Xᵢ - X̄)'S⁻¹(Xᵢ - X̄)` is the squared Mahalanobis distance of the `i`-th observation from the sample mean.
-   **Principal Component Analysis**: Analyzing principal component scores can be insightful. Outliers might have large scores on the first few principal components (inflating variance) or the last few (violating correlation structure).

## Chapter 9: Bayesian Approach to Outliers

A Bayesian framework provides an alternative to classical outlier tests.
-   **Modeling**: Outliers are modeled as coming from a contaminating distribution. Bayesian methods can then compute the posterior probability that any given observation is an outlier.
-   **Guttman's Model**: A notable model assumes a single outlier from `N(μ + a, σ²)`, while the rest are from `N(μ, σ²)`. The posterior distribution of the shift parameter `a` is a mixture of `t`-distributions. The posterior probability that `a` is non-zero provides a measure of evidence for an outlier.

## Conclusion

The book provides a thorough treatment of the statistical theory for identifying outliers across a wide range of distributions and models. It emphasizes a principled approach, grounding outlier detection methods in statistical optimality theory while also providing practical procedures and tables for their application. The discussion of the masking effect in the context of multiple outliers and the complexities of outlier detection in linear and multivariate models are particularly salient contributions.
