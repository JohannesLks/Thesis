# Analysis of "NIST Special Publication 800-207: Zero Trust Architecture"

### 1. Structured Summary

**Publication Details:**
*   **Title:** Zero Trust Architecture
*   **Publication:** NIST Special Publication 800-207
*   **Authors:** Scott Rose, Oliver Borchert, Stu Mitchell, Sean Connelly
*   **Date:** August 2020

#### **Objective**
The primary objective of NIST SP 800-207 is to provide a comprehensive definition and abstract model for Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA). It aims to guide enterprise security architects in understanding, planning, and deploying Zero Trust principles. The document moves cybersecurity defenses from static, network-based perimeters to a more dynamic, resource-focused model where trust is never implicit. It assumes that networks are always compromised and that every access request must be continuously verified, regardless of its origin.

#### **Methodology/Framework**
The publication defines ZTA through a set of core logical components and guiding tenets. The framework is not a rigid implementation plan but a set of principles for designing secure systems.

*   **Core Logical Components:**
    *   **Policy Engine (PE):** The decision-making component that grants or denies access based on enterprise policy and external data feeds (e.g., threat intelligence, device state).
    *   **Policy Administrator (PA):** The component that establishes and terminates communication paths based on the PE's decisions.
    *   **Policy Enforcement Point (PEP):** The component that enables, monitors, and terminates connections between a subject and a resource.

*   **Tenets of Zero Trust:**
    1.  All data sources and computing services are considered resources.
    2.  All communication is secured regardless of network location.
    3.  Access to resources is granted on a per-session basis.
    4.  Access is determined by dynamic policy (based on identity, device health, and other attributes).
    5.  The enterprise monitors the integrity and security posture of all assets continuously.
    6.  All resource authentication and authorization are dynamic and strictly enforced before access is allowed.
    7.  The enterprise collects as much information as possible to improve its security posture.

#### **Key Concepts**
*   **De-Perimeterization:** The foundational idea that network location is no longer the primary factor for security. The "trust" boundary is shifted from the network edge to the individual resource.
*   **Implicit Trust Zones:** ZTA aims to shrink implicit trust zones to be as small as possible, ideally containing only a single resource. This prevents lateral movement by attackers.
*   **Dynamic Policy and Trust Algorithm:** Access decisions are not static but are calculated dynamically by a "Trust Algorithm" that considers multiple factors, including user identity, device health, location, time, and threat intelligence.
*   **Continuous Verification:** Authentication and authorization are not one-time events. They are continuously re-evaluated throughout a session.

#### **Main Findings/Recommendations**
The publication recommends a gradual, iterative migration to ZTA rather than a complete overhaul. Organizations should start by identifying critical assets and business processes and then implementing ZTA principles for those specific use cases. The document emphasizes that most enterprises will operate in a hybrid mode, combining ZTA with traditional perimeter-based security for the foreseeable future. A strong foundation in identity management (ICAM), device management (CDM), and risk assessment (RMF) is crucial before embarking on a ZTA journey.

### 2. Relevance to Thesis (ADLAH)

NIST SP 800-207 provides the foundational cybersecurity philosophy and architectural principles that directly justify and inform the design of the **Adaptive Deep Learning Anomaly Detection Honeynet (ADLAH)** described in [`The-Paper/access.tex`](The-Paper/access.tex). While the NIST document describes a general enterprise security model, ADLAH can be seen as a specialized, offensive-counterintelligence implementation of a ZTA framework.

*   **ADLAH as a ZTA Implementation:** The ADLAH architecture mirrors the core ZTA components.
    *   The **Reinforcement Learning Agent** in ADLAH functions as the **Policy Engine (PE)** and **Policy Administrator (PA)**. It makes the dynamic decision (`deploy` or `wait`) based on real-time data (`first-flight` analysis) and enacts that policy by triggering the deployment and traffic redirection.
    *   The **MADCAT Sensor** combined with the `iptables` redirection mechanism acts as the **Policy Enforcement Point (PEP)**. It is the gatekeeper that controls access to the high-interaction honeypot resources.

*   **Shrinking the Implicit Trust Zone:** A traditional honeynet can be considered a large implicit trust zone. ADLAH follows the ZTA principle of minimizing this zone. The initial state is zero trust; no high-interaction resource is exposed. Only after the RL agent (the PE/PA) makes an explicit, per-session trust decision is a resource (a high-interaction pod) created and access granted. This directly aligns with NIST's tenets of per-session access and is a direct improvement over static honeypots that are always exposed.

*   **Dynamic, Risk-Based Policy:** The ADLAH thesis explicitly frames the RL agent's function as a dynamic decision-making process. The agent uses `first-flight` data to assess the "risk" or "potential intelligence value" of an incoming connection. This is a direct implementation of the ZTA tenet that "Access to resources is determined by dynamic policy." The envisioned use of anomaly scores from the autoencoder in the reward function (as described in [`The-Paper/access.tex:435`](The-Paper/access.tex)) is a sophisticated form of the "Trust Algorithm" mentioned in NIST SP 800-207, where the "trust" score is a measure of potential intelligence novelty.

*   **Continuous Monitoring and Improvement:** NIST SP 800-207 emphasizes the need to collect as much information as possible to improve security posture. The ADLAH architecture is built on this concept. The "intelligence refinement loop" in the thesis, where logs are analyzed to identify novel behaviors and retrain models, is a perfect example of this principle. The system learns from every interaction to make better future decisions, creating a feedback loop that strengthens the entire defensive posture, as recommended by NIST.

In summary, NIST SP 800-207 provides the strategic "why" for a system like ADLAH. It validates the core architectural choices—dynamic deployment, per-session analysis, and learning from observed behavior—as being aligned with the modern consensus on best-practice cybersecurity architecture. ADLAH operationalizes the defensive Zero Trust philosophy into a targeted, resource-efficient threat intelligence gathering system.
