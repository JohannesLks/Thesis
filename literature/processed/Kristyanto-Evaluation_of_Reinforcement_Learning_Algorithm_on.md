# Analysis of "Evaluation of Reinforcement Learning Algorithm on SSH Honeypot"

## Structured Summary

This document provides a summary and analysis of the paper "Evaluation of Reinforcement Learning Algorithm on SSH Honeypot" by Kristyanto, Studiawan, and Pratomo (2022).

*   **Objective:** The primary goal of the research was to evaluate the impact of integrating a Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithm with an SSH honeypot. The study aimed to measure whether an RL-enhanced honeypot could prolong interaction time with attackers compared to a standard, non-learning honeypot, thereby gathering more detailed information about attacker behavior.

*   **Environment/Task:** The experiment was conducted using a `Cowrie` SSH honeypot deployed on the Alibaba Cloud. The RL agent's task was to learn from attacker command inputs and select an action to adapt the honeypot's response. The ultimate goal for the agent was to encourage the attacker to execute a `download` command (e.g., `wget`, `curl`), which was considered the most valuable action for intelligence gathering. The environment consisted of the live honeypot system, and the state was defined by the sequence of commands entered by the attacker.

*   **Algorithms Compared:** The paper implements and evaluates a **Deep Q-Network (DQN)**, which is a variant of Q-Learning that uses a neural network. It compares the performance of a `Cowrie` honeypot modified with this DQN agent against an unmodified, default `Cowrie` honeypot. While the paper mentions SARSA in the related work section as used in a prior project (`RASSH`), the direct experimental comparison in this study is between DQN-enhanced `Cowrie` and standard `Cowrie`.

*   **Key Findings:**
    *   **Increased Interaction Time:** The key finding was that the `Cowrie` honeypot integrated with the RL module achieved a significantly longer average session duration (**5.28 seconds**) compared to the unmodified `Cowrie` honeypot (**1.57 seconds**).
    *   **Adaptive Responses:** The RL agent could choose from five actions (Allow, Delay, Block, Fake, Insult) in response to an attacker's command, making the honeypot's behavior less predictable.
    *   **Attacker Behavior Patterns:** The analysis revealed a common pattern of commands executed by attackers before attempting a download:
        1.  System information gathering (e.g., `cat /proc/cpuinfo`).
        2.  Filtering output (e.g., using `uniq` or `grep`).
        3.  Executing a download command (`wget`).
        4.  Running a script (e.g., `perl`).
    *   **Reward Function Efficacy:** The study demonstrated that a carefully designed reward function, which heavily rewarded download commands and penalized session terminations, successfully guided the RL agent's learning process toward the desired objective of prolonging engagement.

### Relevance to Thesis (ADLAH)

This paper provides highly relevant experimental insights for the development of the **ADLAH (Adaptive Multi-Layered Honeynet Architecture)**, particularly for the design of its central RL agent.

*   **Algorithm Selection for the RL Agent:** The paper's successful implementation of DQN offers a strong precedent for ADLAH. It empirically demonstrates that a Q-Learning-based approach can effectively learn attacker patterns in a live cybersecurity environment to achieve a specific goal (prolonging interaction). For ADLAH, the choice between Q-Learning (off-policy) and SARSA (on-policy) is critical. Q-Learning's aggressiveness might lead to discovering optimal deception strategies more quickly but could also risk premature attacker detection if the chosen actions are too unusual. SARSA’s more conservative, on-policy nature might result in a "safer" agent that learns to mimic typical system behavior more closely, which is crucial for maintaining the honeypot's believability. This paper's results validate Q-Learning's effectiveness and provide a baseline against which a SARSA agent for ADLAH could be compared.

*   **State, Action, and Reward Design:** The methodology used in the paper serves as a direct template for formalizing the ADLAH control loop:
    *   **State:** The paper uses the attacker's command history as the state. ADLAH can adopt a more sophisticated state representation that includes not just command history but also the source IP's reputation, the sequence of services interacted with across the honeynet, and real-time network traffic metrics (e.g., packet velocity, data volume).
    *   **Action:** The actions `(Allow, Delay, Block, Fake, Insult)` are directly applicable to ADLAH's low-interaction services. For the multi-layered architecture, these can be expanded to higher-level actions, such as **"Redirect attacker to a different honeypot," "Deploy a new high-interaction decoy,"** or **"Increase logging verbosity for the current session."**
    *   **Reward Function:** The paper's reward structure, which assigns high value to specific attacker actions (`download command`), is a foundational concept for ADLAH. The ADLAH reward function can be similarly designed to maximize information gain by rewarding actions like privilege escalation attempts, discovery of decoy files, or prolonged interaction with high-value targets, while penalizing actions that indicate the attacker is about to disengage.

*   **Performance Benchmarks:** The performance metrics used—**average session duration** and **total commands executed**—are essential and directly transferable benchmarks for evaluating the ADLAH agent. By measuring how these metrics improve as the ADLAH agent learns, we can quantitatively demonstrate its effectiveness in deceiving attackers and gathering more useful intelligence compared to a static honeynet configuration. This provides a clear, data-driven method for validating the core hypothesis of the ADLAH thesis.
