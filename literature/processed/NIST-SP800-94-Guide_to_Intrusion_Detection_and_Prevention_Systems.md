# Analysis of "Guide to Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDPS)"

### 1. Structured Summary

*   **Title:** Guide to Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDPS)
*   **Authors:** Karen Scarfone, Peter Mell
*   **Publication:** NIST Special Publication 800-94

#### Objective
The primary objective of this guide is to provide a comprehensive overview of Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDPS). It aims to assist organizations in understanding the principles, technologies, and best practices for designing, implementing, configuring, securing, and maintaining effective IDPS solutions. The document serves as a practical guide for security practitioners, administrators, and program managers responsible for defending information systems.

#### Methodology/Framework
The NIST guide establishes a detailed taxonomy for IDPS technologies, categorizing them based on the type of events they monitor and their deployment architecture. The core framework presented is organized around four principal types of IDPS:

1.  **Network-Based IDPS:** Deployed at strategic points within the network (e.g., near firewalls) to monitor traffic for suspicious activity in network and application protocols. They can be deployed *inline* to actively block threats or *passively* to monitor a copy of the traffic.
2.  **Wireless IDPS:** Specifically designed to monitor wireless network traffic, analyzing wireless protocols (e.g., IEEE 802.11) to detect attacks, rogue access points, and misconfigurations.
3.  **Network Behavior Analysis (NBA):** Focuses on identifying threats that generate unusual traffic flows, such as DDoS attacks, worms, and policy violations. NBA systems often work by creating a baseline of normal network behavior and detecting significant deviations.
4.  **Host-Based IDPS (HIDS):** Installed on individual hosts (servers, workstations) to monitor internal system characteristics and events. HIDS can analyze system logs, file system modifications, running processes, and application activity, providing visibility into activity that network-based sensors cannot see (e.g., encrypted traffic).

The guide also outlines three primary detection methodologies used by these systems:
*   **Signature-Based Detection:** Compares observed events against a database of known threat patterns (signatures). Effective for known threats but ineffective against novel attacks.
*   **Anomaly-Based Detection:** Establishes a profile of normal behavior and flags significant deviations. Capable of detecting unknown threats but can be prone to false positives.
*   **Stateful Protocol Analysis:** Compares observed protocol activity against vendor-developed profiles of benign protocol definitions. It can identify unexpected protocol sequences and states.

#### Key Concepts
*   **IDPS Components:** The guide defines a standard architecture consisting of **sensors/agents** (for monitoring), a **management server** (for centralized control and correlation), a **database server** (for storing event data), and a **console** (for user interface).
*   **Inline vs. Passive Deployment:** A critical distinction for network-based sensors. Inline sensors sit directly in the traffic path and can perform active prevention, whereas passive sensors analyze a copy of the traffic and have more limited response capabilities.
*   **Security Capabilities:** The functions of an IDPS are broken down into information gathering, logging, detection, and prevention.
*   **Tuning and Customization:** The process of altering IDPS configurations (e.g., thresholds, blacklists, whitelists) to improve detection accuracy by reducing false positives and false negatives.
*   **Integration:** The guide emphasizes the need to use multiple IDPS types for comprehensive security and discusses integrating them directly or indirectly via a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system.

#### Main Findings/Recommendations
1.  **Use Multiple IDPS Types:** No single IDPS technology can provide complete protection. A robust solution requires a combination of network-based, host-based, and potentially wireless and NBA systems to achieve comprehensive visibility.
2.  **Secure the IDPS Infrastructure:** IDPS components are high-value targets for attackers. All components (sensors, servers, consoles) must be hardened, kept up-to-date, and communications between them should be secured, preferably over a dedicated management network.
3.  **Define Requirements Before Selection:** Organizations must thoroughly define their security goals, environmental characteristics, and resource constraints before evaluating and selecting IDPS products.
4.  **Prioritize In-Depth Analysis:** Modern IDPS should combine signature-based, anomaly-based, and stateful protocol analysis to achieve broad and accurate detection.
5.  **Test and Tune Continuously:** IDPS solutions require significant initial and ongoing tuning to adapt to changing environments and threats. Organizations should perform limited hands-on testing before deployment and periodically review configurations.

### 2. Relevance to Thesis (ADLAH)

The Adaptive Deep Learning Anomaly Detection Honeynet (ADLAH) architecture, as detailed in [`The-Paper/access.tex`](The-Paper/access.tex:1), represents a significant evolution of the concepts laid out in the NIST SP 800-94 guide. While the guide provides a foundational taxonomy for IDPS, ADLAH introduces a novel, hybrid system that extends this framework by integrating adaptive orchestration and reinforcement learning.

#### How ADLAH Fits into the NIST IDPS Taxonomy

*   **Sensor Type:** The ADLAH sensor node, which runs MADCAT, functions as a **network-based sensor**. It is deployed at the network edge to monitor all inbound traffic, consistent with the typical placement of network-based IDPS sensors described by NIST. Its "first-flight" data analysis is a specialized form of network traffic monitoring.

*   **Honeypots as an IDPS Capability:** The NIST guide briefly mentions **honeypots** as a complementary technology. However, the guide treats them as largely passive data collection tools. ADLAH fundamentally reframes this by making the deployment of high-interaction honeypots a **dynamic prevention/response capability** of the IDPS itself. In NIST terms, deploying a high-interaction honeypot is a sophisticated form of "changing the security environment".

*   **Analysis Engine:** The RL-driven core of ADLAH constitutes a novel form of **analysis engine**. Traditional IDPS analysis engines, as described by NIST, decide whether an alert is warranted. The ADLAH agent's decision is fundamentally different: its primary output is an *orchestration action* (deploy or wait), not just an alert. This represents a paradigm shift from passive detection to active, intelligent resource management.

#### Comparison and Contrast with NIST Concepts

*   **Static vs. Dynamic Architecture:** The NIST guide describes IDPS architectures that are largely static. Sensors are deployed in fixed locations, and their rulesets are updated periodically. In sharp contrast, the ADLAH architecture is inherently **dynamic and adaptive**. The system's composition changes in real-time based on observed threats, orchestrating the deployment of high-interaction honeypots on demand. This moves beyond the "in-service" adaptation of a single honeypot to full **infrastructure-level adaptation**, a concept not covered in the NIST guide.

*   **Detection Methodology:** ADLAH's "first-flight" analysis, using a DQN and LSTM, is a form of **anomaly-based detection**. It learns a model of interesting versus uninteresting initial connection patterns to make its deployment decisions. The full architectural vision, which incorporates an adaptive autoencoder for post-interaction log analysis, further extends this by creating a continuous online learning loop to identify novel adversary behavior—a sophisticated implementation of the anomaly detection principles outlined by NIST.

*   **Prevention and Response:** The NIST guide categorizes prevention as stopping an attack, reconfiguring the environment, or altering the attack's content. ADLAH's response mechanism—transparently redirecting an adversary to a fully interactive honeypot—is a unique form of "changing the security environment" that focuses on maximizing intelligence gain rather than simply blocking the connection. While a traditional IPS might drop a suspicious packet, ADLAH escalates the engagement, a philosophical departure from the blocking-centric prevention model.

*   **Management and Operation:** NIST highlights the significant human effort required for tuning and managing traditional IDPS. ADLAH's core thesis is to automate this process through reinforcement learning. The RL agent is designed to learn an optimal deployment policy autonomously, reducing the need for manual rule-writing and tuning. Its reward function, especially the envisioned quality-based metric, directly addresses the challenge of managing the high volume of low-value alerts (false positives) that plagues traditional IDPS.

In conclusion, ADLAH builds upon the foundational principles of IDPS articulated in NIST SP 800-94 but extends them into a new domain of intelligent, adaptive, and automated cyber deception. It is not merely a sensor or a honeypot but an integrated system where the sensor acts as a trigger for a dynamic, ML-driven response that redefines the concept of intrusion prevention from a simple "block" action to a strategic "engage and analyze" decision.
