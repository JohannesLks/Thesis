# Analysis of "Adaptive Honeypot Engagement through Reinforcement Learning of Semi-Markov Decision Processes"

This document provides a summary and contextual analysis of the paper "Adaptive Honeypot Engagement through Reinforcement Learning of Semi-Markov Decision Processes" by Linan Huang and Quanyan Zhu.

### Summary of Key Concepts

The paper presents a framework for optimizing attacker engagement in a honeynet using a **Semi-Markov Decision Process (SMDP)**, which is enhanced by **Reinforcement Learning (RL)** to overcome the challenge of not knowing the attacker's model in advance (the "curse of modeling").

The core problem is managing the trade-off between the **reward** of gathering high-quality threat intelligence and the **risks** associated with active engagement. These risks include:
1.  **Honeynet Discovery (T1):** The attacker identifies the environment as a honeypot and either leaves or provides misleading information.
2.  **System Penetration (T2):** The attacker uses the honeypot as a pivot to attack the real production system.
3.  **Excessive cost (T3):** The operational costs of the engagement (e.g., generating deceptive traffic) outweigh the value of the intelligence gathered.

#### 1. Modeling with Semi-Markov Decision Processes (SMDP)

The attacker's movement within the honeynet is modeled as an SMDP. This is a powerful choice because, unlike a standard Markov Decision Process (MDP), an SMDP allows the time spent in any given state (the "sojourn time") to be a continuous random variable. This is more realistic for modeling attacker behavior, as they might spend variable amounts of time in different parts of the network.

*   **States (`S`):** Represent the attacker's location within the honeynet (e.g., a specific honeypot, the production network, or a virtual "ejected" state).
*   **Actions (`A`):** The defender's choices at each state. For example, in a honeypot, actions could be:
    *   `a_E`: Eject the attacker.
    *   `a_P`: Passively record activities.
    *   `a_L`: Low-interaction engagement.
    *   `a_H`: High-interaction engagement.
*   **Transition Probabilities (`tr`):** The probability of moving from one state to another, given the defender's action.
*   **Sojourn Time (`z`):** The probability distribution of the time an attacker spends in a state before transitioning, which depends on the state and the defender's action.
*   **Reward/Cost (`r`):** Quantifies the value of the interaction. It includes immediate costs for actions and a continuous rate of reward (for intelligence) minus the cost (for maintaining the engagement). A discount factor `γ` is used to model the decreasing value of information over time.

The goal is to find an **optimal policy (`π*`)**—a mapping from states to actions—that maximizes the long-term expected utility (total discounted reward).

#### 2. Game-Theoretic Undertones

While the paper primarily uses an SMDP/RL framework, it is fundamentally about a "game" between the defender and the attacker. The defender's actions influence the attacker's behavior (sojourn time and transitions), and the defender seeks to optimize their outcome (intelligence) while minimizing losses (risk and cost). This framing aligns perfectly with game theory, even if it doesn't explicitly solve for a Nash Equilibrium in the traditional sense. The framework models the strategic interaction where each player's decision affects the other's utility.

*   **Payoffs:** The defender's payoff is the "investigation value," while the attacker's payoff is implicitly tied to their success in compromising valuable systems (which the SMDP model tries to prevent).
*   **Strategies:** The defender's strategy is the learned policy `π*`. The attacker's strategy is their sequence of actions, which the SMDP model represents as probabilistic transitions and sojourn times.
*   **Equilibrium:** The optimal policy `π*` can be seen as the defender's best response to the modeled (and learned) behavior of the attacker.

#### 3. Reinforcement Learning for an Unknown Attacker

The authors acknowledge that creating an accurate `a priori` model of an attacker is often impossible. To solve this, they use **Q-learning for SMDPs**. The defender (RL agent) learns the optimal policy by observing interactions in the honeynet over time, without needing a pre-defined model of the attacker. It learns the Q-values for state-action pairs from real interaction samples, eventually converging on the optimal policy.

### Relevance to Thesis (ADLAH Integration)

This paper's methodology offers a formal and highly relevant blueprint for enhancing the **ADLAH (Adaptive Multi-Layered Honeynet Architecture)**. The principles can be directly integrated to formalize and improve its adaptive capabilities.

#### 1. Modeling the Attacker-Honeynet Interaction

The interaction in ADLAH can be modeled as a game, precisely as described in the paper.

*   **Players:**
    1.  **The Defender:** The central ADLAH RL agent.
    2.  **The Attacker:** The adversary interacting with the honeynet.

*   **Actions:**
    *   **Defender (ADLAH):** The set of actions corresponds to the strategic decisions ADLAH can make. This includes:
        *   **Honeypot Configuration:** Deploying a low-interaction (e.g., Cowrie) vs. high-interaction (e.g., a full Linux VM) honeypot.
        *   **Deceptive Content:** Modifying the file system, available services, or user accounts.
        *   **Network Topology:** Altering routing rules to guide the attacker towards or away from certain honeypots.
        *   **Ejection:** Terminating the attacker's session.
    *   **Attacker:** The sequence of commands or exploits they execute. This is what ADLAH observes.

*   **Payoff Matrices (Utility):**
    *   **ADLAH's Payoff:**
        *   **High Positive:** Eliciting novel TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures), capturing new malware samples, or identifying zero-day exploits. This is the **investigation value**.
        *   **Negative:**
            *   High operational cost (e.g., running many high-interaction honeypots).
            *   Attacker escaping the honeynet and compromising the production environment (the ultimate failure).
            *   The attacker identifying the honeypot and disengaging.
    *   **Attacker's Payoff:**
        *   **High Positive:** Successfully compromising what they perceive to be a valuable target, exfiltrating data, or establishing persistence.
        *   **Negative:** Wasting time and resources on a worthless or deceptive target (the honeypot), or having their tools and methods discovered.

#### 2. Informing the RL Reward Function

The SMDP formulation provides a sophisticated structure for ADLAH's reward function, moving beyond simple metrics. The total reward can be a function of both event-based rewards and continuous costs.

`R_total = R_event + ∫(r_info(t) - c_ops(t)) dt`

*   `R_event`: A discrete reward/penalty for specific events (e.g., a large positive reward for capturing a unique malware binary, a large negative penalty for an escape attempt).
*   `r_info(t)`: A continuous reward rate based on the quality of data being generated by the attacker at time `t`. For instance, executing rare commands or accessing "bait" files would yield a higher rate.
*   `c_ops(t)`: The continuous operational cost rate of the current honeypot configuration. A high-interaction honeypot would have a higher `c_ops` than a low-interaction one.

This structure allows ADLAH to balance the **quality of intelligence** against the **cost and risk** of the engagement in real-time.

#### 3. Predicting Attacker Behavior

The paper's model assumes attackers are rational in the sense that their actions (transitions, sojourn times) are influenced by the environment created by the defender. ADLAH can use this concept to predict attacker behavior.

By learning the transition probabilities `tr(s' | s, a)`, ADLAH can answer critical strategic questions like: "If I deploy a high-interaction honeypot (`a_H`) in the current state (`s`), what is the probability the attacker will move to the sensitive data server (`s_critical`)?" This predictive capability is core to proactive defense.

#### 4. Deception as a Strategy

Game theory provides the perfect lens for formalizing deception. ADLAH's actions are strategic moves in a "deception game."
*   **Deploying a honeypot** is an act of deception.
*   **Configuring it** to look like a valuable but vulnerable target (e.g., a "juicy" database server) is a deceptive move designed to influence the attacker's strategy.
*   **The goal** is to manipulate the attacker's perception of their own payoff matrix, leading them to take actions that are beneficial to the defender (i.e., revealing their TTPs in a contained environment). The SMDP/RL framework provides the mechanism to learn the most effective deceptive strategies over time based on real-world feedback.
