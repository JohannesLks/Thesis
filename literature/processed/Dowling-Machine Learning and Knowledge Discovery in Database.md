# Analysis of "Using Reinforcement Learning to Conceal Honeypot Functionality" by Dowling et al.

This paper presents a more in-depth and focused study on using Reinforcement Learning (RL) to enhance honeypot capabilities, specifically to counteract automated detection mechanisms employed by malware like the Mirai botnet. Unlike the broader framework proposed in "A New Framework for Adaptive and Agile Honeypots," this work details the implementation and results of a specific RL-based honeypot. It appears to be the primary, more detailed research paper, while the others might be derivative or summary works.

The core contribution is an adaptive honeypot that learns the optimal responses to attacker commands to prolong interaction and capture more extensive data. The system uses a **State-Action-Reward-State-Action (SARSA)** algorithm.

-   **State Space (S):** The state is defined by the command received from the attacker. The paper categorizes commands into Known Linux commands (L), Custom attack commands (C), Compound commands (CC), unsupported commands (NF), and others (O).
-   **Action Space (A):** The honeypot can choose one of three actions in response to a command: `allow`, `block`, or `substitute`.
-   **Reward Function (R):** The RL agent is given a reward of `+1` if the command is in the set {L, C, CC}, thereby incentivizing the agent to take actions that lead to more valid subsequent commands. Otherwise, the reward is `0`.

The experiment involved deploying two `Cowrie` honeypots: a standard high-interaction one and the RL-adaptive one. The adaptive honeypot demonstrated a clear learning curve. Initially, it, like the standard honeypot, only captured the first 8 commands of a 44-command Mirai-like bot attack sequence. However, after approximately 16 attacks, the RL agent learned to `block` a `mount` command—a known honeypot detection technique—which allowed it to proceed further into the attack chain. By the 42nd attack, it had optimized its policy, capturing the full sequence.

The result was that the adaptive honeypot collected **four times more command transitions** than the standard high-interaction honeypot, a significant improvement over previous works which reported a three-fold increase. The paper also demonstrates policy evaluation, showing that a **Boltzmann Softmax** exploration strategy converged faster than the Epsilon-Greedy approach in a controlled environment.

Finally, the authors propose an amendment to Seifert's honeypot taxonomy, suggesting the addition of an **"Adaptive"** value to the "Interaction Level" class to account for honeypots that can learn from attacker interactions.

### Relevance to Thesis

This paper is highly relevant to the design of the **ADLAH (Adaptive Multi-Layered Honeynet Architecture)**, offering a concrete, validated model for the adaptive layer.

1.  **Reinforcement Learning Model:** The SARSA-based approach detailed in this paper provides a direct, proven blueprint for implementing the RL agent in ADLAH's application-layer honeypots (e.g., SSH, Telnet). The defined state space (command types), action space (`allow`, `block`, `substitute`), and reward function (maximizing command transitions) can be adopted as a baseline for the ADLAH agent's decision-making process.

2.  **Evasion of Anti-Honeypot Techniques:** The paper's primary success was in overcoming automated honeypot detection. This is a critical requirement for ADLAH, which aims to engage sophisticated adversaries. The ability to learn and neutralize detection probes (like the `mount` command) is a key feature that ADLAH must incorporate to maintain its deception.

3.  **Policy Optimization:** The finding that a Boltzmann Softmax policy outperformed Epsilon-Greedy is an important insight. ADLAH can incorporate this by using Boltzmann for its exploration strategy, potentially leading to faster adaptation and more effective deception with fewer interactions. This aligns with ADLAH's goal of being "agile" and adapting quickly to new threats.

4.  **Taxonomy and Conceptual Framing:** The proposed addition of "Adaptive" to the honeypot taxonomy reinforces the conceptual foundation of ADLAH. It validates the idea that a learning-based, adaptive honeypot represents a new class of security tool, distinct from static high/low-interaction honeypots. This strengthens the theoretical underpinnings of the thesis.

In summary, this paper moves from the high-level framework presented in other works to a specific, successful implementation. It provides the ADLAH project with a detailed, evidence-backed RL architecture that directly addresses the core challenge of creating a truly adaptive and resilient honeynet.
