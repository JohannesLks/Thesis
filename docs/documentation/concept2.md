## 2. Introduction
The detection of anomalies and reconstruction of attack chains in unstructured honeypot logs represents a complex challenge. Existing literature offers valuable inspiration but also exposes clear gapsâ€”particularly when handling massive, unlabeled datasets and detecting multi-session or long-tail attacks. 

This document proposes a critically designed architecture and theoretical framework that:
- Leverages **line-level** and **session-level** deep learning models,
- Constructs **dynamic temporal graphs** to represent inter-session relationships, and
- Employs **graph neural networks (GNNs)** to uncover distributed attack patterns.

Given the large-scale nature of production honeypot data, our focus is on an unlabeled 500 GB dataset provided by the BSI (German Federal Office for Information Security). Its considerable size and lack of explicit ground truth necessitate a fully unsupervised approach. For validation and partial ground-truth checks, classic intrusion datasets such as **KDD Cup 99** and **NSL-KDD** will be leveraged. This combination facilitates comprehensive benchmarking: the BSI dataset tests scalability and real-world complexity, while the labeled sets confirm detection accuracy on known attack classes.

## 3. Proposed Architecture: Enhanced Conceptual Design

### 3.1 Key Innovations

1. **Line-Level Modeling**  
   - **Lightweight Sequence Autoencoder:**  
     Process individual log lines as byte sequences using a denoising autoencoder.  
     - Each log line $l_i$ is mapped to an embedding vector $e_{l_i} \in \mathbb{R}^d$ from the bottleneck layer.
     - The reconstruction error serves as a line-level anomaly score.

2. **Session-Level Modeling**  
   - **Hybrid Transformer-LSTM Module:**  
     Aggregate sequential log line embeddings into coherent session representations $e_{s_i}$, capturing both local (short-term) and global (long-range) dependencies.
   - **Temporal Attention Mechanism:**  
     Enhances the model's ability to weigh significant events in a session based on their temporal context.

3. **Temporal Relationship Modeling**  
   - **Dynamic Session Graphs:**  
     Construct graphs where each node represents a session, and edges reflect both semantic distance $D(s_i, s_j)$ between session embeddings and temporal proximity $T(s_i, s_j)$, with an exponential decay factor to prioritize recent correlations.

4. **Graph Neural Network Layer**  
   - **Scalable GNNs:**  
     Employ subgraph sampling techniques (e.g., GraphSAGE or Cluster-GCN) to process large, evolving graphs efficiently, consolidating session embeddings to detect distributed or persistent threats.

5. **Fusion Layer**  
   - **Attention-Based Fusion Mechanism:**  
     Combine:
       - Line-level anomaly scores,
       - Session-level anomaly indicators, and
       - GNN-based cluster embeddings.
     This fusion yields a comprehensive anomaly indicator that reflects both local and global patterns.

6. **Improved Attack Chain Extraction**  
   - **Two-Stage Process:**
     1. **Coarse Temporal Clustering:**  
        Use methods like DBSCAN on timestamp embeddings to group sessions that are temporally adjacent.
     2. **Fine-Grained Community Detection:**  
        Apply community detection algorithms (e.g., the Leiden algorithm) to identify subgroups with high anomaly cohesion, effectively reconstructing multi-step attack chains.

7. **Explainability**  
   - **GNNExplainer and Heatmaps:**  
     Generate interpretable subgraph-level explanations and line-level heatmaps to highlight which features or log tokens most contributed to the anomaly score, aiding security analysts in quickly understanding suspicious activity.

## 4. Mathematical Background

### 4.1 Problem Setup
- **Honeypot Log Lines:**  
  $$
    L = \{l_1, l_2, \dots, l_n\}
  $$
- **Grouped into Sessions:**  
  $$
    S = \{s_1, s_2, \dots, s_m\}
  $$
- **Per-Line Embeddings:**  
  $$
    e_{l_i} \in \mathbb{R}^d
  $$
- **Session Embeddings:**  
  Obtained via a hybrid model:
  $$
    e_{s_i} = \text{TransformerLSTM}(s_i)
  $$

### 4.2 Cross-Session Anomaly Cohesion Score (CSACS)
To quantify the anomaly cohesion of a community \( C \) of sessions:
$$
  CSACS(C) = \frac{ \sum_{(s_i, s_j) \in E_C} \left( \lambda_1 \cdot \frac{1}{D(s_i, s_j) + \epsilon} + \lambda_2 \cdot \frac{1}{T(s_i, s_j) + \delta} \right) \cdot \min\bigl(A(s_i), A(s_j)\bigr) }{ |E_C| }
$$

**Where:**
- \( E_C \) is the set of edges among sessions in community \( C \),
- \( D(s_i, s_j) \) is the distance between session embeddings \( e_{s_i} \) and \( e_{s_j} \),
- \( T(s_i, s_j) \) is the temporal gap between sessions,
- \( A(s_i) \) is the anomaly score of session \( s_i \),
- \( \lambda_1, \lambda_2 \) are weighting parameters,
- \( \epsilon, \delta \) are small constants for numerical stability.

### 4.3 Optimization Objective
To balance cluster compactness and size:
$$
  \max_{C} \; CSACS(C) \;-\; \gamma \cdot |C|
$$
where \( \gamma \) is a regularization parameter.

### 4.4 Hypothetical Stability Theorem (Conceptual Proposal)
> **Theorem:** Under Gaussian noise and uniform temporal distribution assumptions, the probability that a random cluster exceeds threshold \( \theta \) decays exponentially with the number of edges:
> $$
>   P\bigl(CSACS(C) \geq \theta\bigr) \;\leq\; \exp\Bigl(-\alpha \cdot |E_C| \cdot \theta\Bigr),
> $$
> where \( \alpha > 0 \) depends on the noise variance.
>
> *Note:* A full proof is beyond this paper's scope; future work will involve both theoretical and empirical validation.

## 5. Data Strategy, Implementation, and Evaluation Plan

### 5.1 Datasets

1. **Unlabeled 500 GB BSI Honeypot Dataset**  
   - Real-world, unstructured data ideal for testing scalability and unsupervised capabilities.
   - Metrics to be measured include detection coverage, throughput (logs/sec), and resource usage (CPU/GPU memory).

2. **KDD Cup 99 / NSL-KDD**  
   - Classic labeled intrusion datasets (though somewhat dated).
   - Used for establishing performance baselines (Precision, Recall, F1) and confirming the detection of known attack classes.

### 5.2 Ablation Studies and Comparative Experiments
We propose **five** key ablation studies:

1. **Autoencoder vs. Transformer for Line Embedding**  
   - **Hypothesis:** A well-trained autoencoder provides robust anomaly scoring; however, Transformer embeddings might offer greater expressiveness.
   - **Metrics:** Reconstruction error, classification performance (where labels exist), and ingestion throughput.

2. **Full Session Model vs. No Session Aggregation**  
   - **Setup:** Compare (a) aggregation of log lines into sessions and (b) independent processing of log lines.
   - **Objective:** Evaluate the impact on detecting multi-step attacks.

3. **Static vs. Dynamic Graph Construction**  
   - **Variant A:** Build a static graph over fixed time windows.
   - **Variant B:** Continuously update the graph with exponentially decaying edge weights.
   - **Goal:** Determine if dynamic adjacency improves chain detection for persistent or slow-moving attacks.

4. **GNN vs. Simpler Aggregators**  
   - **Comparison:** Replace the GNN with a basic aggregator (e.g., an MLP on session embeddings or k-Means clustering).
   - **Question:** Is the additional complexity of a GNN justified by a significant improvement in correlating anomalies?

5. **Fusion vs. Single Anomaly Score**  
   - **Approach:** Compare using a single anomaly score (e.g., from the session model) versus combining multi-level signals (line-level, session-level, GNN-based).
   - **Objective:** Assess if multi-level fusion enhances detection robustness and reduces false positives.

### 5.3 Real-Time Constraints and Overhead Mitigation
- **Subgraph Sampling & Mini-Batch Training:**  
  Techniques like GraphSAGE or Cluster-GCN limit memory usage by processing only portions of the graph.
- **Fallback Autoencoder:**  
  Serves as both a feature generator and anomaly scorer with minimal computational overhead.
- **Asynchronous Pipelines & Approximate Queries:**  
  Use approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) methods for faster edge construction and decouple embedding computation from graph updates to improve parallelism.

### 5.4 Explainability Demonstration
- **Case Studies on the BSI Dataset:**  
  Highlight suspicious clusters using visualizations generated by GNNExplainer.
- **Line-Level Heatmaps:**  
  Provide interpretability for local anomalies by mapping the most significant tokens or segments back to raw log lines.
- **Comparison to Baselines:**  
  Compare our approach with methods like Isolation Forest or simpler autoencoders to illustrate the advantages of deeper embedding and graph-based context.

## 6. Critical Discussion
### 6.1 Integration and Complexity Challenges
- **System Complexity:**  
  Integrating containerized service emulation, deep learning modules, and a DRL control loop introduces nontrivial challenges in data synchronization and maintaining low-latency responses.
- **Computational Overhead:**  
  Transformer-based models and GNNs are computationally intensive. Balancing model complexity with real-time processing demands careful resource management and may necessitate model optimization or compression techniques.

### 6.2 Security and Reliability Concerns
- **Potential Exploitation:**  
  Although containerization offers isolation, any misconfiguration could expose additional attack surfaces. The dynamic nature of the system might also lead to behavioral inconsistencies exploitable by advanced adversaries.
- **False Positives and Adaptive Risks:**  
  Overly sensitive anomaly detection may trigger false positives, leading to unnecessary resource allocation or revealing the system's artificial nature. Conversely, overly aggressive adaptation could alter behavior in a predictable manner.

### 6.3 Future Improvements and Research Directions
- **Robustness Testing:**  
  Extensive stress and adversarial testing under varied attack scenarios are required to ensure system stability and security.
- **Model Optimization:**  
  Investigate more efficient deep learning architectures or model compression to reduce computational overhead without sacrificing detection accuracy.
- **Enhanced Deception Techniques:**  
  Future research might focus on further obfuscating the honeypotâ€™s artificial behavior to make it even less distinguishable from genuine production environments.
