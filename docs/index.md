## ðŸŽ¯ Project Overview
This research project focuses on:
- Unsupervised anomaly detection in real-world, unlabeled honeypot logs
- Modeling attacker behavior across lines, sessions, and time
- Cross-session anomaly scoring (CSACS)
- Automated attack chain extraction

> All results, formulas, and design decisions are documented in the following sections.
