# Honeypot Anomaly Detection Documentation

Welcome to the documentation site for the project: **Unsupervised Multi-Layer Anomaly Detection and Attack Chain Extraction in Unstructured Honeypot Logs**.

## Documentation Access

You can view the full theoretical framework and methodology [here in the documentation section](/documentation).

## Project Overview

This project focuses on developing an unsupervised anomaly detection framework for real-world, unlabeled honeypot logs, modeling attacker behavior across log-lines, sessions, and time, and extracting attack chains.

- ✅ Line-level autoencoders
- ✅ Session-level LSTM sequence modeling
- ✅ Time-based LSTM for cross-session behavior
- ✅ Cross-session anomaly scoring (CSACS)
- ✅ Clustering-based attack chain extraction
- ✅ Mathematical guarantees and proof sketches
