| [**An Unsupervised Deep Learning Model for Early Network Traffic Anomaly Detection**](https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2973023) |  D-PACK: A deep-learning-based anomaly detection system for IoT traffic. Combines a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with an unsupervised Autoencoder to automatically learn traffic patterns and detect malicious flows. Instead of relying on manual, flow-level features or signatures, D-PACK analyzes only the first few bytes of the first two packets of each flow, enabling ultra-early detection. Demonstrates near 100% detection accuracy with a very low false-positive rate (0.83%) in large-scale DDoS scenarios like Mirai-based attacks. Designed for real-time, resource-efficient mitigation of abnormal traffic. | This approach could be helpful, as it utilizes the first bytes of the network packet payload. It might be worth exploring whether I can integrate this method and combine it with other techniques to enhance detection accuracy and keep the model slim. |
[**Anomaly Detection From Log Files Using Unsupervised Deep Learning**](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-54994-7_15) | Unsupervised LSTM Autoencoder model that processes raw log text without preprocessing or handcrafted features. It outputs an anomaly score per log entry, reflecting content and temporal rarity. Trained on 1M HDFS log lines and tested on 1M lines. Acts as a coarse filter for anomaly detection when labeled data is unavailable. | The approach has not been applied to security-related data. However, it aligns well with my concept, as it combines temporal context modeling through LSTMs with an autoencoder. Additionally, it may offer valuable insights, given that it operates on raw, unlabeled data without requiring preprocessing â€” matching the conditions of my use case. |
