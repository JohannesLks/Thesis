| [**An Unsupervised Deep Learning Model for Early Network Traffic Anomaly Detection**](https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2973023) |  D-PACK: A deep-learning-based anomaly detection system for IoT traffic. Combines a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with an unsupervised Autoencoder to automatically learn traffic patterns and detect malicious flows. Instead of relying on manual, flow-level features or signatures, D-PACK analyzes only the first few bytes of the first two packets of each flow, enabling ultra-early detection. Demonstrates near 100% detection accuracy with a very low false-positive rate (0.83%) in large-scale DDoS scenarios like Mirai-based attacks. Designed for real-time, resource-efficient mitigation of abnormal traffic. | This approach could be helpful, as it utilizes the first bytes of the network packet payload. It might be worth exploring whether I can integrate this method and combine it with other techniques to enhance detection accuracy and keep the model slim. |
