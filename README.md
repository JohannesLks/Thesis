## 📅 Upcoming Priorities  

- [ ] Conduct an extended literature search  
- [ ] Assess the identified literature for relevance and summarize key findings  
- [ ] Formulate the research question based on identified gaps in the literature  
- [ ] Create a rough thesis outline and initial concept draft  
- [ ] Discuss and align the draft with Prof. Dr. Krauss and Prof. Dr. Schneider

## ⏳ Planned (Backlog)  

- [ ] Select a suitable journal that aligns with the research question and offers good publication prospects  
- [ ] Familiarize myself with the journal's submission guidelines and formatting requirements  
- [ ] Define the structure and layout of the paper based on both the draft and the journal's specifications  
- [ ] Begin the practical implementation phase  
- [ ] Test Prof. Dr. Schneider’s AI server setup with my model  
- [ ] Develop and refine the deep learning model according to the research question and chosen approach  
- [ ] If necessary, conduct comparative analyses or deeper implementation explorations  
- [ ] Prepare and adapt the results to match the journal’s format and guidelines  
- [ ] Submit the paper for publication consideration
