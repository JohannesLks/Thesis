| [**An Unsupervised Deep Learning Model for Early Network Traffic Anomaly Detection**](https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2973023) |  D-PACK: A deep-learning-based anomaly detection system for IoT traffic. Combines a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with an unsupervised Autoencoder to automatically learn traffic patterns and detect malicious flows. Instead of relying on manual, flow-level features or signatures, D-PACK analyzes only the first few bytes of the first two packets of each flow, enabling ultra-early detection. Demonstrates near 100% detection accuracy with a very low false-positive rate (0.83%) in large-scale DDoS scenarios like Mirai-based attacks. Designed for real-time, resource-efficient mitigation of abnormal traffic. | This approach could be helpful, as it utilizes the first bytes of the network packet payload. It might be worth exploring whether I can integrate this method and combine it with other techniques to enhance detection accuracy and keep the model slim. | IEEE Access | IEEE | ⭐⭐⭐ | [Click Me](https://github.com/JohannesLks/Thesis/blob/main/literature/annotated/An_Unsupervised_Deep_Learning_Model_for_Early_Network_Traffic_Anomaly_Detection.pdf)  | 2020 | 159 |
[**Anomaly Detection From Log Files Using Unsupervised Deep Learning**](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-54994-7_15) | Unsupervised LSTM Autoencoder model that processes raw log text without preprocessing or handcrafted features. It outputs an anomaly score per log entry, reflecting content and temporal rarity. Trained on 1M HDFS log lines and tested on 1M lines. Acts as a coarse filter for anomaly detection when labeled data is unavailable. | The approach has not been applied to security-related data. However, it aligns well with my concept, as it combines temporal context modeling through LSTMs with an autoencoder. Additionally, it may offer valuable insights, given that it operates on raw, unlabeled data without requiring preprocessing — matching the conditions of my use case. | Formal Methods.

[**DeepLog: Anomaly Detection and Diagnosis from System Logs through Deep Learning**](https://doi.org/10.1145/3133956.3134015) | DeepLog: Uses an LSTM-based deep learning model to treat system logs as language sequences. Automatically learns normal log patterns and detects anomalies when deviations occur. Supports incremental online updates to adapt to new patterns over time. Builds workflows from logs to aid in root cause analysis. Outperforms traditional log-based anomaly detection methods in large-scale experiments. | While DeepLog presents an elegant approach by modeling system logs as sequences using LSTM-based architectures and autoencoders to learn normal patterns, it also has significant limitations in the context of this work. The entire approach is focused on structured system logs and does not extend to network traffic, interactive attacker behavior, or unstructured data streams. This log-centric design makes it far from suitable for honeypot or intrusion detection scenarios, where anomalies frequently occur in network flows, command sequences, or multi-modal attacker interactions. Additionally, the model is not designed to handle complex, heterogeneous data sources typical in security monitoring setups, and it lacks flexibility for incorporating contextual or behavioral information beyond static logs. Therefore, despite being a prominent example of sequence-based anomaly detection, its applicability in honeypot-based or network-level anomaly detection is limited. | CCS '17: Proceedings of the 2017 ACM SIGSAC Conference on Computer and Communications Security | ACM | ⭐⭐ | [Click Me](https://github.com/JohannesLks/Thesis/blob/main/literature/annotated/DeepLog_Anomaly_Detection_and_Diagnosis_from_System_Logs.pdf) | 2017 | 1055 |
[**Unsupervised Machine Learning Techniques for Network Intrusion Detection on Modern Data**](https://doi.org/10.1109/CSNet50428.2020.9265461) | The paper compares four unsupervised models (PCA, Isolation Forest, One-Class SVM, and Autoencoder) for intrusion detection on the CIC-IDS-2017 dataset. All models are trained on benign traffic only, focusing on zero-day attack detection. The autoencoder outperforms others with an AUROC of 0.9775 and an F1 score of 0.9616, combining high recall and precision. The OC-SVM is best when low false positives are critical. The study highlights the trade-off between detection performance and computational efficiency, with all models being fast and suitable for real-time deployment. Autoencoders and OC-SVMs are recommended for robust, adaptive NIDS. | This paper is highly relevant to my thesis as it provides a structured comparison between several unsupervised learning algorithms for intrusion detection, directly addressing the challenge of detecting unknown, zero-day attacks. The evaluation on CIC-IDS-2017 aligns with my focus on modern, realistic datasets. In particular, the paper's demonstration of autoencoders' ability to capture complex attack patterns without manual feature engineering supports my approach of using deep learning for feature extraction in honeypot-based environments. Moreover, the discussion on computational overhead, model optimization, and threshold selection provides valuable insights for practical system design. The results showing the superior balance between detection accuracy and runtime efficiency of autoencoders can guide my architecture choice. The OC-SVM’s performance in minimizing false positives also offers potential for integration as a fallback or secondary detection stage in my work. | 2020 4th Cyber Security in Networking Conference (CSNet) | IEEE | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | [Click Me](https://github.com/JohannesLks/Thesis/blob/main/literature/annotated/Unsupervised_Machine_Learning_Techniques_for_Network_Intrusion_Detection_on_Modern_Data.pdf) | 2020 | 26 |
[**A Deep Learning Approach for Intrusion Detection Using Recurrent Neural Networks**](http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2762418) | The authors test their RNN-based IDS (RNN-IDS) on the NSL-KDD dataset for both binary (normal vs. anomaly) and multiclass classification (normal, DoS, R2L, U2R, Probe). They preprocess the dataset with feature encoding and normalization and use a fully connected RNN model. The paper compares RNN-IDS against traditional machine learning algorithms (J48, SVM, Random Forest, ANN) and a reduced-size RNN approach from prior work. Results show that RNN-IDS outperforms classical methods in accuracy, detection rate, and false-positive rate, although training times are longer (not GPU-enabled). The authors suggest that with GPU acceleration and advanced architectures (LSTM, BiRNNs), even better results are achievable. | This paper is helpful for my thesis in multiple ways. First, it demonstrates that even relatively simple RNN architectures can outperform classical machine learning models on benchmark datasets like NSL-KDD — without GPU acceleration and using fairly basic setups. This reassures me that more modern approaches (GPU training, LSTMs, attention mechanisms) will easily surpass those results. Second, the paper is very technical and methodical; it explains each step, including dataset structure, feature preprocessing, and hyperparameter tuning. This shows me how straightforward it is to fill out these sections in my own thesis. Finally, by showing performance analysis in both binary and multiclass classification with confusion matrices, training times, and metrics like accuracy, TPR, and FPR, it sets a clear template for how I can structure and present my own results in a way that will be accepted as thorough and rigorous. | IEEE Access | IEEE | ⭐⭐ | [Click Me](https://github.com/JohannesLks/Thesis/blob/main/literature/annotated/A_Deep_Learning_Approach_for_Intrusion_Detection_Using_Recurrent_Neural_Networks.pdf) | 2017 | 1228 |
[**AutoLog: Anomaly detection by deep autoencoding of system logs**](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2021.116263) | AutoLog proposes a semi-supervised deep autoencoder model that uses entropy-based scoring on log chunks from heterogeneous systems. Scores from normal operations train the model; deviations are detected via reconstruction error. It does not rely on log structure or templates and works across distributed systems. Evaluated on industrial, microservices, BG/L supercomputer, and Hadoop logs, AutoLog achieved recall between 0.96 and 0.99 and precision between 0.93 and 0.98, outperforming isolation forest, one-class SVM, decision trees, and variational autoencoders. | This work is relevant due to its template-independent design and ability to handle heterogeneous, unstructured log data without prior feature engineering. The entropy-based scoring combined with deep autoencoding offers a robust method for anomaly detection in noisy, multi-source environments. This aligns with my approach for adaptive anomaly detection in dynamic, complex honeypot setups, where structured features are not always available. | Expert Systems with Applications | Elsevier | ⭐⭐⭐ | [Click Me](https://github.com/JohannesLks/Thesis/blob/main/literature/annotated/AutoLog_Anomaly_detectio_%20by_deep_autoencoding_of_system_logs.pdf) | 2021 |
[**An anomaly detection method to detect web attacks using Stacked Auto-Encoder**](http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/CFIS.2018.8336654) | Proposes an anomaly detection method for web attacks using a stacked autoencoder (SAE) for feature extraction and isolation forest as a one-class classifier. Uses character-level n-gram models for feature construction (mostly unigram and bigram), which suffers from high dimensionality. SAE architecture consists of layers with 1000, 400, and 100 hidden neurons, quadratic loss function, and experiments with different optimizers (Adam, RMSProp, etc.). Results show improvement over simple n-gram models, but the paper is written in poor English, uses outdated hardware, and lacks depth. | Only marginally relevant. The approach (SAE + isolation forest) is interesting but not innovative. Mostly helpful for fine-tuning my research gap and showing how not to design evaluation setups. Demonstrates the difference between short conference papers and more thorough research. | 2018 6th Iranian Joint Congress on Fuzzy and Intelligent Systems (CFIS) | IEEE | ⭐ | [Click Me](https://github.com/JohannesLks/Thesis/blob/main/literature/annotated/An_anomaly_detection_method_to_detect_web_attacks_using_Stacked_Auto-Encoder.pdf) | 2018 | 73 |
[**Anomaly Detection for HTTP Using Convolutional Autoencoders**](http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2881003) | Proposes a novel anomaly detection approach for HTTP traffic using a convolutional autoencoder (CAE) combined with character-level binary image transformation. Instead of manual feature engineering, HTTP messages are converted into binary "images" representing characters, which are then processed by a modified Inception-ResNet-v2 CAE. Detection is based on reconstruction errors (BCE) and a novel decision metric, binary cross varentropy (BCV), which captures variance properties. The model is trained unsupervised on normal HTTP traffic and achieves superior performance compared to one-class SVMs, Isolation Forest, and a shallower CREPE-based CAE. The paper also evaluates character embedding but finds minimal performance gains. Trained on ~129,000 HTTP messages and evaluated on ~26,000 messages. Demonstrates strong results with low false-positive rates (~4% at TPR 0.99) and high MCC/F1. | Very interesting due to the use of CAEs with character-level transformation, showing that feature engineering can be avoided. The use of BCV as a decision metric is novel and may offer inspiration for alternative scoring metrics in my honeypot setup. However, the approach is tailored to structured HTTP data and image-like transformations; it’s unlikely that this technique would generalize to packet-level byte streams or more complex, mixed traffic. Additionally, their infrastructure relies on large GPU resources (4× Tesla P100), which might not scale well for real-time inference without significant optimization. Overall, the paper helps to sharpen my research gap: my focus is on packet-level raw byte processing, multi-modal attacker behavior, and resource-efficient, real-time detection rather than protocol-specific image encodings | IEEE Access | IEEE | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | [Click Me](https://github.com/JohannesLks/Thesis/blob/main/literature/annotated/Anomaly_Detection_for_HTTP_Using_Convolutional_Autoencoders.pdf) | 2018 | 33 |
[**A Deep Learning Approach to Network Intrusion Detection**](http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TETCI.2017.2772792) | This paper presents a novel intrusion detection approach using multi-layer non-symmetric deep auto-encoders (NDAEs) for unsupervised feature learning, followed by a shallow learning classifier based on Random Forest. The architecture consists of multiple stacked NDAEs for deep feature extraction, after which the learned representations are classified using a Random Forest model. The system is implemented in GPU-enabled TensorFlow and evaluated on the KDD Cup '99 and NSL-KDD datasets. Results demonstrate significant improvements in detection accuracy and false positive rates compared to traditional machine learning approaches, showcasing its potential for application in modern network intrusion detection systems. | This paper is highly relevant, as it presents a deep feature extraction approach combined with a lightweight classifier (Random Forest). The concept of using unsupervised representation learning and passing the results to a separate shallow classifier aligns well with my idea of balancing deep learning and efficiency. The methodology could serve as a foundation for combining unsupervised feature learning with scalable classifiers in modern honeypot-based anomaly detection. The use of the kdd dataset and the reference to other paperps who used this dataset could be helpful for my evaluation. The overall structure could be helpful for my paper as well. | IEEE Transactions on Emerging Topics in Computational Intelligence | IEEE | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | [Click Me](https://github.com/JohannesLks/Thesis/blob/main/literature/annotated/A_Deep_Learning_Approach_to_Network_Intrusion_Detection_.pdf) |  2017 | 1039 |
