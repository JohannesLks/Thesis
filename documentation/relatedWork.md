| [**An Unsupervised Deep Learning Model for Early Network Traffic Anomaly Detection**](https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2973023) |  D-PACK: A deep-learning-based anomaly detection system for IoT traffic. Combines a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with an unsupervised Autoencoder to automatically learn traffic patterns and detect malicious flows. Instead of relying on manual, flow-level features or signatures, D-PACK analyzes only the first few bytes of the first two packets of each flow, enabling ultra-early detection. Demonstrates near 100% detection accuracy with a very low false-positive rate (0.83%) in large-scale DDoS scenarios like Mirai-based attacks. Designed for real-time, resource-efficient mitigation of abnormal traffic. | This approach could be helpful, as it utilizes the first bytes of the network packet payload. It might be worth exploring whether I can integrate this method and combine it with other techniques to enhance detection accuracy and keep the model slim. | IEEE Access | IEEE | ⭐⭐⭐ | [Click Me](https://github.com/JohannesLks/Thesis/blob/main/literature/annotated/An_Unsupervised_Deep_Learning_Model_for_Early_Network_Traffic_Anomaly_Detection.pdf)  | 2020 |
[**Anomaly Detection From Log Files Using Unsupervised Deep Learning**](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-54994-7_15) | Unsupervised LSTM Autoencoder model that processes raw log text without preprocessing or handcrafted features. It outputs an anomaly score per log entry, reflecting content and temporal rarity. Trained on 1M HDFS log lines and tested on 1M lines. Acts as a coarse filter for anomaly detection when labeled data is unavailable. | The approach has not been applied to security-related data. However, it aligns well with my concept, as it combines temporal context modeling through LSTMs with an autoencoder. Additionally, it may offer valuable insights, given that it operates on raw, unlabeled data without requiring preprocessing — matching the conditions of my use case. | Formal Methods.

[**DeepLog: Anomaly Detection and Diagnosis from System Logs through Deep Learning**](https://doi.org/10.1145/3133956.3134015) | DeepLog: Uses an LSTM-based deep learning model to treat system logs as language sequences. Automatically learns normal log patterns and detects anomalies when deviations occur. Supports incremental online updates to adapt to new patterns over time. Builds workflows from logs to aid in root cause analysis. Outperforms traditional log-based anomaly detection methods in large-scale experiments. | While DeepLog presents an elegant approach by modeling system logs as sequences using LSTM-based architectures and autoencoders to learn normal patterns, it also has significant limitations in the context of this work. The entire approach is focused on structured system logs and does not extend to network traffic, interactive attacker behavior, or unstructured data streams. This log-centric design makes it far from suitable for honeypot or intrusion detection scenarios, where anomalies frequently occur in network flows, command sequences, or multi-modal attacker interactions. Additionally, the model is not designed to handle complex, heterogeneous data sources typical in security monitoring setups, and it lacks flexibility for incorporating contextual or behavioral information beyond static logs. Therefore, despite being a prominent example of sequence-based anomaly detection, its applicability in honeypot-based or network-level anomaly detection is limited. | CCS '17: Proceedings of the 2017 ACM SIGSAC Conference on Computer and Communications Security | ACM | ⭐⭐ | [Click Me](https://github.com/JohannesLks/Thesis/blob/main/literature/annotated/DeepLog_Anomaly_Detection_and_Diagnosis_from_System_Logs.pdf) | 2017 |
