## General Observations
> *Date: 18.3.2025*  
-  The paper should mention the differences and parallels between IDS and Honeypot. The proposed solution could find application in both domains.


---

## possible research gaps
- practical implementation of an Autoencoder with the specific BSI data. (Not enough theoratically work)
- integrating current aproaches but developing a solution to use the classified information to make the honeypot adaptive to the attacker to gather more information of its behaviour
- combining current approaches to one new solution (just first bytes, without preprocessing and feature extraction on raw data, system logs als language sequences, non-symmetric data dimensionality reduction, stacked NDAEs and the RF classification algorithm)

## Questions to Clarify
> *Date: 19.3.2025*  
-  A typical journal paper ranges from 5 to 15 pages, while a regular bachelor's thesis is around 40 pages. Would a highly focused and concentrated 15-page paper, demonstrating significant research quality and depth, be sufficient as a bachelor's thesis?
